Usabillity:
the user is not expected to be extremely familiar with the software. The only issue is
whether they can use a smart phone or not.

Reliablillty:
the system will be using some sort of log in feature to make sure that the customers don't
get access to what managers / keepers can do witht he system. The system will also be logging errors
this will help define issues that come up. During failures we may be able to use a website as a back up for the system instead
of an app on the smartphone.

Performance:
This system will be able to support as many users as the zoo has visitors. we
want this system to be as fast as possible with the user in mind. logging in should
take less than one minute always. also transactions should take no longer than 30 seconds. Schedules
should be created and displayed quickily without hindering users time.

Supportablillty:
This system may need a system admin to maintain and handle errors for the system. 
the system admin may also extend the system by adding exhibits.
